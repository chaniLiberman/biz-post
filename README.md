## Description
On this website you can view a variety of businesses and see their extended details and contact methods by clicking on the card. If you connect to the system as a regular user, you can add a card to your favorites and remove it by entering the fav-card You can log in as a business user or as an administrator and then add your own cards and edit or delete cards you added in the my-card tab. Pay attention to the change of display and permissions for each type of user. You can change the site view to dark-mode by clicking on the moon. The sandbox tab has not yet been built according to Mor instructions. In addition, in certain components such as the register, I exceeded the limit of 200 lines because of the multiple content in this component and not because of the way the code was written..
